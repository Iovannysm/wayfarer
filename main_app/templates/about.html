    <h2 class="about-project-title">About the Project</h2>
    <p>Project Wayfarer (or as it was called for our team, Tripelocity) was a simulated client project during our General Assembly SEI boot camp. The basis for the project was that we had been commissioned to build a travel community app for users to share tips (AKA posts) about their favorite locations around the world. We were to use basic wireframes and user stories provided by the client as the starting base of our app and to follow the client's requirements as we grew the app further. The goal was to gain experience working on a development project in a group while navigating a client's feature list.</p>
