1,Golden Gates,"This is a great landmark and worth a visit. BUT, if you have a rental car, beware of smash and grab thieves. Apparently the hoodlums look for cars with the renal car bar code in the windshield and target these cars for smash and grab. Our rear passenger window was broken out while we were away from our car only 15 minutes. We were fortunate to have not had anything in the car. A group of 6 tourists who had parked next to us in a minivan lost ALL their luggage, electronics etc. There were about six cars in the lot we were in that were broken into in that short period of time. The police were on site immediately; this is a known problem at this site. Park somewhere else, walk or taxi in. Then maybe you can enjoy this magnificent bridge without being the victim of thieves and vandals.",11/7/21 16:35,1,1

4,Palace of Fine Arts,"Beautiful homes, beautiful people, and a beautiful backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge welcome visitors to the Marina. Originally the location for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915 (whose remnants can be seen at the Palace of Fine Arts), much of the land was filled and flattened to accommodate a world's fair. That ample space has given way to a jogger's paradise at the northern edge of the city. With the picturesque bay setting as its backdrop, itï¿½s no surprise that the area has hosted numerous movie productions. Daytime activities focus on cafe culture and boutique shopping, while the evenings turn this neighborhood into a party-going hotspot.",11/7/21 16:35,1,1
5,Golden Gates Park,We went all over this park. The only downside is the cost of entering some sections. We paid for the Japanese Tea Garden but would have been better to have paid for the conservatory instead. The trail to the ocean was nice as were the windmills and gardens. Also the lake island.,11/7/21 16:35,1,1
